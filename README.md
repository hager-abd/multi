This project is a simple and useful web platform 
Allows users to record videos or upload videos from their devices. 
These videos are then displayed in a section called "Display Videos" where users can watch them. 
The website also includes a meeting system. In the "Do Meeting" page, a user can enter their name and create a new meeting with a unique ID.
Another user can join this meeting from the "Join Meeting" page by entering their name and the same meeting ID. 
This project helps users to communicate using video and audio easily and provides both media sharing and real-time meeting features in one place. 
This project was built using HTML to structure and display the web pages, CSS to manage and style the design, and JavaScript to add functionality and interactivity to the platform.
